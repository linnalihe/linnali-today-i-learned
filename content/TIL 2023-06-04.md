##### Importance of good communication and key action points
Collaboration and open communication among team members can lead to increased productivity and innovation.

Software engineering is a collaborative field, so the ability to work effectively in a team is important. I want to work with people with good interpersonal and communication skills to ensure they can collaborate with other team members, share knowledge, contribute to discussions, and work towards common goals.

Regular communication with customers, providing exceptional customer support, and maintaining strong relationships helps build strong relationships and trust. It will also help you work with cross-functional teams, stakeholders, and potential clients.

- Being able to get ideas across effectively by explaining in different ways and maybe multiple times
- Being able to explain technical concepts by providing relatable examples
- Being able to listen actively to others to understand their point of view
