##### Practice PR review in JavaScript/TypeScript
I had to do a PR review as part of my interview for a startup and it was a nice exercise. My previous company had conventions in place and I worked in Python. I took the opportunity to brush up on some JavaScript/TypeScript and reinforce some PR review best practices. Things I learned
- Read the description to understand the PR and what it intends to do
- Clone the repo/branch locally and set it up
- Run the tests locally to check if any fails
- Read through the tests to understand the code better
- Naming of the tests in a way that describes what is being tested
- Jest allows you to parametrize tests
- Look for areas of the code that can be simplified or modularized into functions
- if it's a matter of preference use `nit` or some other indicator that the change is only a suggestion and not a requested change.

##### Vagrant for automation
Went through the exercise of setting up virtual machines with Vagrant and took some notes [[Udemy DevOps Beginners to Advanced with Projects Section 3 VM Setup]]
##### Reviewing sorting
I've been going back through Interview Kickstart after ignoring it for several months and rewatched the video on sorting, focused on problem-solving. I've taken notes [[IK Sorting Part 1 and 2 by Omkar Deshpande]] as I followed along and the main takeaway is to group problems into categories of `brute force`, `decrease and conquer`, `divide and conquer`, and `transform and conquer`.
