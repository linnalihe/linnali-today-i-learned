##### Reviewing Linux commands
I'm aware of a lot of the Linux commands but I don't use them very much. I'm going through a DevOps course on Udemy and taking some notes [[Udemy DevOps Beginners to Advanced with Projects Section 4 Linux]]
##### RC Coding Faster
Attended a discussion group about how to overcome blockers and code and build things faster. The problem I encounter is that I often do more research than I need to before taking action. One solution is to find the smallest piece that I can take action on before any additional research and do that as a first step. It's good to pair with others regularly to learn their processes and try it if it seem like something helpful. Different people learn different aspects of a topic or skill and being exposed to their perspective widens your perspective. We also discussed TDD as a way to scope down the problem and find the solution that can get the tests to pass as a way to focus.
##### Cloud Certifications
I was made aware that there are certifications for AWS, Azure and GCP and a whole ecosystem around it. Learning can be to sign up for Udemy courses or go on Cloud Academy. Seems like being a AWS community builder gets you a free subscription to Cloud Academy for a year https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/.
