##### Virtual onsite interview with Canary Technologies
Had my virtual onsite with Canary Technologies today and had a conversational round with an engineer focused mostly on how I like to work, my knowledge and opinion on engineering, the tech stack, and other technical topics. I had another conversational round with the hiring manager which focused more on the people side of the job but also talked about the technicalities of the Python Flask framework. We were supposed to dissect and talk through and implementation but never got there so that portion is probably not in my favor. I took note of this in my personal notes vault. 

##### Mock interview recursion with knights dialer problem
I had a mock interview via IK and worked through the problem knights dialer and managed to come up with a decent solution. The interviewer shared that he got the problem from the following webpage:

I have trouble wrapping my head around recursion where we return values via for loop and this might be a good resource to study and understand. This flavor of recursion falls under tree recursion and I can try to think about it in a tree structure where each node returns a value to the parent node.
