##### Reviewed pre-calculus concepts for understanding big-O
I'm brushing up on data structures and algorithms and vaguely remember arithmetic and geometric series from high school. I'm able to follow with explanations of time complexity but thought it was better to just review by watching some videos by Khan Academy on YouTube and taking some notes [[YT Arithmetic and Geometric sequences and series]]

##### Find bargain produce at your grocery store
I had to go buy corn and oat milk today and decided to check out the bargain produce section at Market Basket. 
I think they are a Massachusetts-specific grocery store. They had a huge pack of 99-cent blueberries. 95% of the blueberries were good. It would have probably been more than $6 for the amount I bought. I also got 2 crowns of broccoli for $1.49 each, and a bag of sweet potatoes for a couple of dollars. The only thing is to make sure you're able to eat most of what you buy from the bargain section the day of purchase or the day after. 
I still bought the corn that was $4.99 a pack of 5 corn ðŸŒ½
Food prices are high nowadays ðŸ’¸
