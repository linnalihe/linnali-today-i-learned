##### I can't follow schedules either
Usually, I either undershoot the time I need to spend on each item on the schedule or I overshoot. Just like how [[TIL 2024-02-06#Calendars don't work for me]] I can't seem to stick to a pre-planned schedule for learning. I'm usually good at focusing if I have a priority so I'm going to create a list of things I want to work on and determine the priority for the day and focus on one or two things each day.

I feel like I spend 90% of the time planning and the rest of the 10% of time not following the plan

##### Be able to implement sorting in less than 10 minutes
Knowing Merge-sort, Quick-sort, and Heap-sort algorithms is extremely helpful even if it's unlikely that you'll be asked to implement them during an interview. This is because components of these algorithms can be repurposed to solve and/or help with the reasoning for the solution of other problems.
