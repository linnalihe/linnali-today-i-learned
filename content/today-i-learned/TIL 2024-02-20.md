##### It's been a couple of weeks and I forgot recursion again
I've solved this problem at least 10 times in the past but somehow when I had a friend give me a low-key mock interview on a whiteboard I forgot how to solve the problem. This is the classical recursion problem that can be optimized using a dynamic programming solution. 

Adding up the number of times can also be kept track of using two variables for the iterative solution. A recursive solution that is also linear time

```
def fibonacci(n):
	def add_seq(n, first, second):
		if n < 1:
			return first
		return add_seq(n-1, second, first+second)
	return add_seq(n, 0, 1)
```
