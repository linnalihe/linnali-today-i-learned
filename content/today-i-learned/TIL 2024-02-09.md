##### Mentorship as rocket fuel for growing as an engineer 
I noticed that I learned a lot quicker when there's someone pointing me in the right direction and I in return share my expertise as much as I can. It turns out others feel the same and there's an existing mentorship culture amongst software engineers. 

I just read through [Developers mentoring other developers: practices I've seen work well](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/developers-mentoring-other-developers/) and some key takeaways I got is that mentorship should be two way relationship where both the mentor and the mentee will learn something from the engagement. It doesn't matter where you are at in your career, it's important to seek out mentors. There's always more to learn. Likewise, seek out opportunities to mentor others to share your knowledge and get feedback from a fresh perspective.

##### Hosting is expensive at renewal
The promotional price when I signed up for BlueHost via an affiliate link was $2.95/month and somehow I got it for about 3 years. 

If you get it directly from the website today it's $3.95/month for a 12-month term. 

I got an email from BlueHost recently and saw that it was >$800 for 3 3-year renewal. 

I was pretty shocked. The price increase is a lot steeper than I thought. I renewed for a quarter at ~$80 and will be finding a cheaper way to host.
