##### Tech Behavioral interviews
Keep the action items to 3 bullet points and when you talk through the STAR method during behavioral interviews, make sure to focus on your ability to overcome problems and deliver value for your team and the company. 

##### Important points to keep in mind when speaking with a recruiter

Flexibility is key for the recruiter!
