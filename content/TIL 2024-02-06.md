##### Spending too much time on organizing notes
It's 2AM and I'm organizing my Obsidian vault. I've noticed that I periodically have to organize my vault because I try to use tags or try a new daily note template and I still haven't found something that works in the long term. I've decided that daily notes do not work for me because I like seeing my progress in one note so I'm reverting back to what I had way back in the day which is to use a single file for the entire year. Each day I'll add the day and within the day's section I will add my todo list and any thoughts I have. If the thought is longer form than I'll create a separate note for it.

##### Calendars don't work for me
So many people in the productivity space swear that calendars help them stay focused and productive but I just don't find them helpful. I've tried so many times. I would spend hours deciding on my schedule but I rarely stick to it past the first day. If there is no consequence for missing a calendar block, I just ignore what I've scheduled. A checklist works a lot better for me because I want the satisfaction of crossing out out. Does that make me an outlier?
