##### Chick-Fil-A along Upstate NY I-90
I spent most of my day in the car today along upstate New York's I-90 and noticed the rest stops are all new buildings and instead of McDonalds I see Chick-Fil-A. I ended up buying a spicy chicken sandwich and 8-piece chicken nuggets along with Burger King. I can't say I'm a fan. There was a line at Chik-Fil-A but no line at Burger King. I think I preferred the whopper junior over the chicken sandwich. 

The main question I have is why they replaced the old buildings. It seems a bit wasteful to tear the entire building down and reconstruct a new one. Wouldn't renovating the existing buildings use less materials? I guess people usually like buying something new rather than repairing. 

##### Cover letter to tech companies
I usually don't think to write cover letters because I've been given the advice that hiring managers don't look at them. But sometimes they do and it's another data point to provide. I'm applying to a company through a referral and the referrer specifically asked for a cover so it's likely going to pull some weight. 
The cover letter needs to have a hook at the beginning, tell the reader why you're interested in the company or their team, and highlight what makes you stand out as a candidate by describing your past achievements and your mindset.
