- I then shared an example from just the day before, when I hadn’t done a good job walking the line between giving actionable feedback and micromanaging the details. My report looked relieved by the end of my story. “Thank you for that,” he said. “It was incredibly helpful.” ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=816))
    - Note: Give examples that relate to the others challenges. Share that you also experience this or that you recognize its difficult.
- Even if you sit next to someone and see him every day, 1:1s let you discuss topics that may never come up otherwise—for example, what motivates him, what his long-term career aspirations are, how he’s generally feeling about his work, and more. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=848))
    - Note: 1-1s are a time to focus on the reportees goals and concerns.
- Remember that your job is to be a multiplier for your people. If you can remove a barrier, provide a valuable new perspective, or increase their confidence, then you’re enabling them to be more successful. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=853))
    - Note: Manager is there to provide multiplier affect
- Discuss top priorities: What are the one, two, or three most critical outcomes for your report and how can you help her tackle these challenges? Calibrate what “great” looks like: Do you have a shared vision of what you’re working toward? Are you in sync about goals or expectations? Share feedback: What feedback can you give that will help your report, and what can your report tell you that will make you more effective as a manager? Reflect on how things are going: Once in a while, it’s useful to zoom out and talk about your report’s general state of mind—how is he feeling on the whole? What’s making him satisfied or dissatisfied? Have any of his goals changed? What has he learned recently and what does he want to learn going forward? ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=857))
    - Note: Talking points for 1-1s
- Don’t presume you know what the problem or solution is. Too often, attempts to “help” aren’t actually helpful, even when served with the best of intentions. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=865))
    - Note: Dont try to solve the reportees problem, empowerr them to solve it themselves.
- Your report should have a clear sense at all times of what your expectations are and where he stands. If he is often wondering, What does my manager think of me? then you need to dial up your level of feedback. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=889))
    - Note: Manager needs to be clear on the reportees standing to give them sufficient info in their performance as well as continual motivation.
- the thing that’s often the most helpful isn’t advice or answers but empathy. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=902))
    - Note: Empathy is important!
- By recognizing a strength of mine, Chris gave me a renewed sense of motivation. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=922))
    - Note: Dont solve reportees problem, express that you trust their judgement and confident in their ability to solve the problem
- “There is one quality that sets truly great managers apart from the rest: they discover what is unique about each person and then capitalize on it,” says Buckingham, the renowned management consultant who has studied hundreds of organizations and leaders. “The job of a manager . . . is to turn one person’s particular talent into performance.” ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=939))
    - Note: Each person is different, have differing strengths and weaknesses, capitalize on their strengths.
- It’s a romantic notion in popular media—Sherlock Holmes, Miranda Priestly, Tony Stark—but in real life, these people are not who you want on your team no matter how talented they are. Instead of a multiplier effect, you get a divider effect: the presence of this person makes the rest of your team less effective. ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=956))
    - Note: Lone wolf contributers are demoralizing for the team and they are not helpful in growing others.
- Don’t compromise your values for someone who thinks it’s okay to bully others. You and your team deserve better. ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=970))
    - Note: There are a lot if talented people, dont compromise on values for output
- I now understand that personal and organizational values play a huge role in whether someone will be happy on a given team. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=987))
    - Note: Many factors cause reportees to leave or be discontent. Dont take it personally if youve done everything that helps them grow and improve/empathetic to their situation
- They just weren’t right for you. These days, I spend a lot of time trying to understand what potential candidates value, as well as being transparent about what my company and I value. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=997))
    - Note: Making sure the fit is correct before commiting. Company values and team relationships needs to be in alignment.
- The person I was trying to help would feel stressed out because he knew he wasn’t doing well, and my “help” felt like the Eye of Sauron watching his every move. Meanwhile, the rest of my team would wait impatiently for things to get better ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=1024))
    - Note: Bad for everyone if underperforming teammate stays around. Misalignment of values, work methods or skills may cause this.
- If this person were not already at the organization, would I recommend that another team hire him or her knowing what I know? ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=1037))
    - Note: Questions to ask when determining moving to another team or firing.
- The best feedback I ever got came from my former report Robyn. Once, when I asked him what I could be doing better, he took a deep breath and said, “Julie, sometimes I get the feeling that when I’m doing well, you’re on my side and the two of us are great. But when I’m not doing as well, our relationship suffers, and I don’t feel that you trust me as much.” He proceeded to share a few examples of things I had said that made him feel this way, delivered with kindness and honesty. This single piece of feedback transformed my entire perspective on management. ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=1062))
    - Note: Example of good feedback between manager and reportee
- For example, after your report presents an analysis, tell her what you thought she did well and what could go better in the future. Be as precise and as detailed as you can. ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=1099))
    - Note: Task specific feedback
- The facets of our personality are like the ingredients that come together for a recipe. ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=1430))
    - Note: Different people have fifferent strength, require diff management style and way to work them together to make team productive
- What opportunities do you see for me to do more of what I do well? What do you think are the biggest things holding me back from having greater impact? What skills do you think a hypothetical perfect person in my role would have? For each skill, how would you rate me against that ideal on a scale of one to five? ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=1471))
    - Note: Questions to ask manager
- “I’m working on making sure my point is clear in the first three minutes. Did that come across? How can I make it clearer next time?” ([Location 1714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=1714))
    - Note: Be specific on what you want to improve when asking for feedback
- how to run a team meeting, how to close a new hire, how to complete a project on time and on budget. If you find yourself doing a similar thing over and over again, chances are good that it can be codified into an instruction manual or checklist that can make the task go smoother in the future. Another bonus of doing this: you can then pass the playbook to others to learn and execute. ([Location 2696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=2696))
    - Note: Systematize
- Success becomes more and more about mastering a few key skills: hiring exceptional leaders, building self-reliant teams, establishing a clear vision, and communicating well. ([Location 2812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=2812))
    - Note: Most important management skills
- 1) what’s most important to the organization and 2) what you’re uniquely able to do better than anyone else. ([Location 2940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=2940))
    - Note: How to maximize your contribution
- No matter if you are the CEO or a front-line manager, building a great team is one of the most important things you can do. ([Location 2973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=2973))
    - Note: Recruiting is important
- Because she was so motivated, I expected to see her try out these tactics right away and ask me and others for more feedback. But I saw no change. A few weeks later, we all went through 360 reviews. This report shared her feedback with me directly. She gave some good suggestions around communication and prioritization. At the very end, she included this bullet: “You rarely ask me or others on the team for feedback, and I’d love to see you do more of it.” It was eye opening. I realized ([Location 3082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079WNPRL2&location=3082))
    - Note: Dont be a hipocrite
