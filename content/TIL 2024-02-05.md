##### Publishing notes using Obsidian and Quartz
Having a system that is easy to use is important to keep me consistent. I've always wanted to publish what I'm learning but I wasn't able to find a framework that works for me. I've tried [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) which is a 5 minute setup but it was not compatible with the way I took notes. I also go hung up on which theme to pick which is arguably a personal problem since it could be a 10 minute decision for some people. But for me it was a dealbreaker because I couldn't find anything that I liked. 

I've been taking notes with Obsidian and will be trying out [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) after watching Nicole's video [How to publish your notes for free with Quartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s6DT1yN4dw&ab_channel=NicolevanderHoeven) which provides a step-by-step guide on setup with GitHub Pages. 

Setting up custom domain with GitHub Pages

Follow instructions on https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages 

TLDR;
- On GitHub, go to the page for "Add a verified domain"
- On NameCheap, add a TXT Record 
	- copy the 1st text without the `.yourdomain.com` to Host column in NameCheap
	- copy the 2nd text to Value column in NameCheap
