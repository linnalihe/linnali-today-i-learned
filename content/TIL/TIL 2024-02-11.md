##### McDonalds menu update with Double Big Mac
There is such a thing as a double big mac now. Apparently it was a thing a few years back and it's making a comeback. I bought one for my younger brother. Didn't eat it so I can't say if it's any good but I prefer not to eat that much meat so I'd never buy it for myself. I'm liking Burger King a lot more to get a burger just because they have the Impossible Burger which tastes like meat but isn't.
