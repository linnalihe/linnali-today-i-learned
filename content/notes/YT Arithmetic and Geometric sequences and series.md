Arithmetic Sequences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cooC3yG_p0
A sequence of terms where subsequent terms are larger than the one before it by a fixed constant
```
{a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d ...a+(n-1)d }
```

Arithmetic Series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy_L8tnihDM
The sum of a arithmetic sequence which you can find by adding the sequence by itself in reverse order and dividing by 2. This actually become the average fo the 1st and last term multiplied by n where n is the length of the sequence.
```
Sum of sequence 
= n (2*a + (n-1)d)/2
= n * ((a + (a+(n-1)d))/2)

```

Geometric sequence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2NnNKtquaE
It's a sequence of terms where subsequent terms are a multiple of the one before by a fixed constant r (common ratio). Subsequent values can be larger or smaller as long as common ratio is the same between the term and the term before it.
```
{a, ar, ar^2, ar^3 ...ar^(n-1)}
```

Geometric series
Sum of a geometric sequence. Series means the sum of a sequence.
Formula for the sum of the sequence can be found by subtracting the sum of the sequence with the product of r multiplied by the sum of the sequence
```
Sum of series - r * (Sum of series)
= a - a*r(n+1)

Sum of series
= (a - a * r(n+1))/(1-r)
```
