Understanding your must-haves and nice-to-haves are essential to choosing the right company when applying as well as when choosing who to go with at the end

Tier 1 are companies that you've identified that you ideally want to work for
Tier 2 are companies that are similar and are good practice
- same interview process as tier 1 companies
- similar business stage
- similar product domain
- same company size

When you accept an offer, you can rescind your offer as long as it's for personal reasons. It won't get you blacklisted, everyone has extenuating circumstances. Try to give 2 weeks notice.

When reaching out on LinkedIn
