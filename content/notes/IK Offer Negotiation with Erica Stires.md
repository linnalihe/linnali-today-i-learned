On levels.fyi, look at and filter for new offers only
Exclude outliers

1. what elements make up your total compensation?
	1. base salary
	2. stock/equity/RSUs
	3. bonus
	4. retirement/401K, benefits, perks (this should not be part of total compensation)

2. what influences rate?
	1. relevance of past contributions?
	2. interview performance
	3. your leverage/negotiation skills (competing offers)
	4. location might play a part

Ranges are becoming more transparent
Don't provide an urgent timeline. Play it cool and let them know that you are waiting for the right opportunity.
Do not tell recruiters that you're rejected by other companies. Keep it ambiguous!
Do not accept the first offer a company extends!

If you've already made some mistakes, you can re-anchor with new information like competing offers. 
Equity is usually the easiest to negotiate. The base is harder.

You are Always Negotiating!
The recruiter is always trying to close on a hire

There isn't an incentive to low-ball nowadays because the data is public knowledge
There is a budget for headcount, if there is no reason to go above the company won't but if you're a rockstar candidate they might give you a high offer that will cut into the budget for other candidates

Know your market value from the beginning! Do your research and anchor correctly starting from the initial conversation!
