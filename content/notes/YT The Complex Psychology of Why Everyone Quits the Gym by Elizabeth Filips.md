1. You quit because it's a rational choice to decrease negative emotions when you decide between "going to the gym" and "not going to the gym". At the decision point, you know you won't enjoy exercising so you choose to not go. When you do motivate yourself to go, it's because your perceived enjoyment of exercising is higher than not exercising.

2. People who go to the gym consistently vs those who don't but want to are because the first group has an immediate enjoyment mindset vs a future enjoyment mindset. 
	- Immediate enjoyment => proximal 
		- will get to try something new
		- will look good in front of others
		- will feel higher energy after
	- Future enjoyment => distal
		- will lose weight in 2 weeks or 1 month
		- will become healthier
		- will become more confidient
		- will reduce my risk for disease

People usually try to motivate themselves with the future distal positive outcomes which are not as effective!!!
